1
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:07,069
No hope have I found

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:13,512
In old beliefs

3
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:18,359
No faith has entered

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,645
 Beneath my skin

5
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:35,376
My clear mind has forsaken me.

6
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:44,930
My eyes are deluding me
