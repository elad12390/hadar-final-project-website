1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000


2
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:20,797
Defiled one!


3
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:25,158
No tomb shall you have!

4
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:31,519
No eulogy shall you receive! 

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:40,814
No tears will be shed for you

6
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,396
Not to the Garden of Eden

7
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:50,335
 Nor to Gehenom, shall you pass

8
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,335
Your damned soul shall wander

9
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,641
Between This World

10
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,048
And the World to Come

11
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,478
Impure one! 

12
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,251
No peace shall you find!

13
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:17,488
No warmth shall you feel in your soul!

14
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:25,911
No grace shall meet your eyes 

15
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,316
For you, Unholy one

16
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:35,282
Have spilled your own blood

17
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,282
For you, Tainted one

18
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:45,324
Have forsaken your own life

19
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:53,269
A sin above all else
